## Overview {.tabset}

This project explores data recorded by the Willamette Falls Fish Ladder from 2001 to 2010. We explored adult fish passage through the fish ladder for three salmon species: coho, jack coho, and steelhead.

This report includes:

- An original times series for adult passage for coho, jack coho, and steelhead salmon. 
- Seasonplots of each species.
- Annual counts of each species, by year.

### Original Time Series 
```{r}
# read in the data and usual clean up 
fish <- read_csv(here("data","willamette_fish_passage.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(date, steelhead, coho, jack_coho) %>% #selecting for the fish of interest 
  replace(is.na(.),0)   #replacing nas with 0 
 

  
#Now I need to covert the df to tsibble (a times series df )
fish_ts <- fish %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>%  #making my date column class: date 
  as_tsibble(key = NULL, index = date)

# pivot data so species is in same column 
fish_ts_pivot <- fish_ts %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = "species", values_to = "count")


## Making a vector for easy facet wrap plot labels
species_vect <- c("Coho", "Jack Coho", "Steelhead")
names(species_vect) <- c("coho", "jack_coho", "steelhead")


## Now i can visualize the data 
ggplot(data = fish_ts_pivot, aes(x = date, y = count, color = species)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow = 3,
             strip.position = 'right',
             labeller = labeller(species = species_vect)) + 
  ## customize axis with cont 'date' class data (Thank you to Nick for showing me this)
  scale_x_date(limits = as.Date(c('2001-01-01', '2010-12-31')),
               date_breaks = "1 year",
               date_labels = "%Y") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#ff9ea2", "#dbb6d6", "#4c8481")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold'),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#dbb6d6"),
    legend.position = "none")

```
**Figure 1.** Time series of Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead counts on the Willamette fish ladder between 2001 and 2010.

Notable Trends: 

- Steelhead seems to have the widest seasonality and access the fish ladder more than the other two species. 
- Coho accessing the ladder seem to be increasing from 2001 to 2005. 


### Seasonplots
(content)
```{r}
# make the seasonplot with gg_season()


fish_ts_pivot  %>% 
  gg_season(y = count,
            pal = c('#ff9ea2', '#dbb6d6', '#4c8481', '#3b444f')) +
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow = 3, strip.position = 'right',
             labeller = labeller(species = species_vect)) +
  labs(x = element_blank(),
       y = 'Daily fish count') +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
               date_labels = "%b") +
  theme_bw() +
    theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = 'bold'),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold'),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = '#dbb6d6'),
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 9),
    legend.position = c(0.08, 0.85),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.9, 'line')
  )

```

**Figure 2.** Seasonplots of Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead accessing the Willamette Fish Ladder. Line color indicates year. 

Notable Trends: 

- Coho and Coho Jack utilize the fish ladder from September to November. 
- Coho has higher daily fish counts in 2010 that recent years. 
- Steelhead utilize the fish ladder much more frequently than Coho and Jack Coho. Peak activity ranges from February through July. 


### Annual counts by species
```{r}
## create a new df that holds annual total by species 
fish_count_yr <- as.data.frame(fish_ts_pivot) %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  group_by(year, species) %>% 
  summarize(year_count = sum(count))

## vizualize annual counts of 3 species 
ggplot(data = fish_count_yr, aes(x = year, y = year_count)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = species),
           color = "#3b444f") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ff9ea2", "#dbb6d6", "#4c8481" ),
                   labels = c("Coho", "Jack Coho", "Steelhead")) +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2001, to = 2010, by = 1),
                     expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(x = element_blank(),
       y = "Annual Counts") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
  
```

**Figure 3.** Annual counts of salmon by species, from 2001 to 2010. 

Notable Trends: 

- Coho counts have increased from 2001 to 2010. 
- Jack Coho counts have been highly variable over the years, with no clear pattern. They are much less common than the Coho and Steelhead. 
- Steelhead does not have a clear trend. 2002 was the best year for the Steelhead, but 2010 did well in comparison to a slight dip in count from 2007 to 2009. Steelhead are the most abundant species we see at this fish ladder.
